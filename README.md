# Capstone 3 Proposals

## 1. UK accent classifier

If you've ever watched British television, you'll know the UK is a cornucopia of different accents. To those with untrained ears outside of the UK, these accents might a little difficult to parse, and perhaps even harder to fully identify. But in many of these shows, predominantly intended for a British audience, the audience might be expected to hear an accent, identify it, and thus gain important information about a character. Essentially, accent identification can be an aspect of the storytelling. So the idea for this project would be to develop a kind of Shazam for British accents, allowing a user to play audio of a speaking character and identify the most likely region of origin for a character. Would use this dataset (https://research.google/tools/datasets/uk-ireland-english-dialects/), and likely would stick with its fairly broad 6 classes/regions in the UK and Ireland.

## 3. Political Spectrum Similarity / Recommender System for National Politics

Probably focusing on House voting records from the last full Congress (116th Congress, 2019-2021), the idea here would be to first use clustering techniques to identify political groups/factions based solely on voting record. Then, using dimensionality reduction to identify the most salient features and combining that with user input in a recommender system that could help them compare their own political opinions with those of their own House representives or other prominent members.
